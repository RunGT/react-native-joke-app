o# Christmas Cracker App

Built using React Native, a simple fix to solve a covid Christmas Crakcer crisis. 

Social distancing has ruined the traditonal cracker pull. I made this App so you don't miss out on the terrible jokes this year.


Press the button to get a new joke.


## Get Started

If do not have expo install it. 

In terminal:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

This bypasses the need to install react-native as expo will cover the installation of React-Native.

To start metro bundler: Head to the root of the app through terminal and type:
```
expo start

```

Metro bundler will now start and you can run the app on Andriod, iOS or via the browser.
