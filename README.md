## Christmas Cracker App

A simple fix to solve a covid Christmas Crakcer crisis. 

Social distancing has ruined the traditonal cracker. I made this App so you don't miss out on the terrible jokes this year.

This is a quick idea to learn how to build a basic react native app. I use an API to render a random joke onto the page.

Press the button to get a new joke.

## Wireframe

After creating the basic idea of the app I decided I wanted to add a bit of design to it.
This is what the app will look like with it's connections.

## Get Started

If you do not have expo install it. 

In terminal:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

This bypasses the need to install react-native as expo will cover the installation of React-Native.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start metro bundler, head to the root of the app through terminal and type:
```
expo start

```

Metro bundler will now start and you can run the app on Andriod, iOS or via the browser.
